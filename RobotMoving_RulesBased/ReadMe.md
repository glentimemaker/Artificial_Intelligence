## Robot Moving Program ##
Design a rule-base expert system for a mobile robot/rover to move from its current position to a goal position while avoiding obstacles.  

Suppose the surface that the rover moves on is divided into m by n square cells, and at any time the rover is in one of these cells with (x, y) coordinates, it can move to position (x,y+1) with no rotation of its axis ,  to (x-1, y+1) or (x+1, y+1) with 45 degrees rotation.  

The goal of the rover is to move from the start cell to a specified destination cell without hitting any obstacle, and to make as few moves as possible.
