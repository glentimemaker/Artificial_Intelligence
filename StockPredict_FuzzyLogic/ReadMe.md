## Stock Predict Program ##
Design a fuzzy trading program to maximize your profit (or minimize your loss). 

Note that the fuzzy system can only find today’s price and today’s MAD and has no knowledge of future prices or future MAD given by the above equations. 

Simulate the system assuming that you can trade no more than once a day at the market open. You have $12,000 to invest, and the maximum number of stock share buy or sell each time is 800. 

Develop your own program for fuzzification, rule evaluation, defuzzification, etc.
